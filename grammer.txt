//A program is composed of many functions/procedures, just listed one after 
another. Procedure is a function that does not return any value. Every legal 
program should have one and only one procedure: 'main()'. This is case 
sensitive, so Main() is incorrect. Of course, a program can have user defined 
functions too. Any function must be defined before the point of call.
